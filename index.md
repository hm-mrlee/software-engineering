# Description
_Software Engineering_ will immerse students in the process of creating software and highlight how the field is one that walks a fine line between the creative and scientific. Students will engage in the study of building, designing, developing, maintaining and retiring software. In addition, students will learn how to visualize a product, explain their design to those with far less technical skill, and then work as a team to create the requested product. Students will engage in a year-long project, whose field of study will vary from year to year.
