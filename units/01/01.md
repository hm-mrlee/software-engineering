Let's make sure your computer is set up! We'll be going over what everything is in class.

## Visual Studio Code
This is the IDE we'll be using for this class, but if you are comfortable with another, feel free to stick with what you are using.

[Click on this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the version corresponding to your computer.

## Python3
Python2 comes pre-installed on most of your computers, but we'll be using Python3 as the standard for this class.

[Click on this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the version corresponding to your computer.

## Git
Git is the version control system we'll be using for this class.

  - **MacOS**: Git should come pre-installed. You can check by typing `git --version` into your Terminal. If it is not installed, you will get a prompt to install it.
  - **Windows**: [Click on this link](https://gitforwindows.org/) to download Git.

    Use the **default settings** during installation -- do not change anything unless you know what you are doing.

    **GitBash** is the Terminal that you will be using.

## Github
Github is the platform we will use to host our repositories.

[Click on this link](https://github.com/) to make an account. Use your school email!

## Github Pages
Once you have a Github account and you are signed in, you can set up your portfolio website. Go to [the Beautiful Jekyll template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#build-your-website-in-3-steps) and follow the instructions.

Only do steps 1 and 2! Don't go beyond that.
