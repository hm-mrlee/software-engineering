title: 1.2 Team Contract
---
Write team contract in class
Team contracts should include
  - schedules and skills
  - individual responsibilities
  - general meeting schedule
  - plan for rotating note-keeper and leader
  - how individuals will be held accountable
  - how to handle conflict when it arises

Essentially a binding agreement for everyone to agree on

If time left over:
Group pair share and compare contracts -- what's similar? What's different?
Is there something you saw that you're like whoa that's a good idea?

Then; lead into holding effective meetings
