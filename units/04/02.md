So far we've learned how to describe *one* variable at a time. Of course, we can compare these descriptions against each other, but we will learn some formalized methods to directly describe these relationships.

## Bivariate Analysis [(slides)][bi]
How do we find and interpret the relationship between two variables? What information can we gain, and what information *can't* we gain?

> ðŸž› contingency tables, chi-square test  
> ðŸž› scatterplot  
> ðŸž› positive, negative association  
> ðŸž› correlation, causation  

## Linear Regression [(slides)][regression]
Once we have an understanding of how two variables are related, how do we use this information to make educated predictions?

> ðŸž› regression line, line equation  
> ðŸž› residuals, least squares  

## And Beyond...
While these topics are beyond the scope of this class, they are integral to higher level statistics! Feel free to explore:

> â–² multivariate analysis  
> â–² matrix, linear combination
