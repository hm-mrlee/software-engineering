# Assignments
I generally _do not_ assign hard deadlines for homework. These assignments are meant for you to learn and practice. However, it is encouraged that you work according to [the schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), so that you can follow along in class. If I notice that you are not keeping up with the homework, I will reach out, followed by a potential discussion with your grade dean.

Though homework is not factored into your semester grade, you will receive feedback in the form of 0-4 and comments to elaborate. Homework may be [resubmitted](https://forms.gle/iyR3c6xHg9vbcnNe9) at any time for new feedback.

|0|I didn't do it.|
|1|I don't know where to start.|
|2|I have a rough idea, but I need a lot of help.|
|3|I can do most of this on my own.|
|4|I can comfortably do this on my own with no help.|

# Discussions
Readings will be given to supplement the course material. Each reading will include a written response, as well as participation in an in-class discussion. These will be graded on a similar 0-4 scale, details of which will be provided for each discussion.

# Assessments
The bulk of the assessments in this course will be through project deliverables, details of which will be given in a timely manner. Examples include project write-ups, prototypes, and software modules.

Tests will provide opportunities for individual assessment. They will only ever cover what you have done for homework, and what we have done together in class.

All assessments will be assigned **letter grades**.

There are no corrections, except for extenuating circumstances discussed between us and your grade dean.

# Academic Honesty
Any submitted work by a group should be a reflection of equal effort of all students involved. Collaboration is encouraged. You are not allowed to look for solutions or copy code directly from outside sources. Students must always note whom they worked with and any outside resources that were used. Failure to do so will result in an integrity penalty.

Any form of cheating will result in a **failing grade** and the student’s advisor will be notified for the first offense. Any subsequent offense will result in the student being asked to speak with their class dean. Forms of cheating include but are not limited to: similar / identical code submitted, solutions submitted that are not a student’s own work.
